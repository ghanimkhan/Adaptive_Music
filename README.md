# Adaptive_Music🎧
##This app Adjust the volume of your music🎧 (audiomanager) as per noise around you by calculating DB( decibels ) which is a unit used to measure the intensity of a sound or the power level of an electrical signal by comparing it with a given level on a logarithmic scale.

🦜Normal conversation  -------> background music	60

🧑🧑🏻Office noise         -------> inside car at 60 mph	70

🧹Vacuum cleaner       -------> average radio	75

🚗🚗 Heavy traffic        -------> window air conditioner, noisy restaurant, power lawn mower	80–89 (sounds above 85 dB are harmful)

                   (  I have provided the sensitivity as per the different levels🎚️ of noise🔊 as mentioned above )
